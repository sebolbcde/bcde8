  title: "Wage Discrimination as a Hidden Switching Regime: The case of Peru."
  bio: "The empirical evidence on wage discrimination focuses on the estimation of wage gaps with respect to particular characteristics that are observed to the econo- metrician such as ethnicity and gender. We revisit the wage gap interpretation by introducing the more realistic assumption that individuals that are supposed to be wage-discriminated according to one characteristic (gender), could in fact end up not being discriminated. Our methodology allows the identification of an overall discrimination wage-gap and the implied discrimination probabilites associated to observed and unobserved discrimination factors. The empirical analysis builds on a pooled cross section of workers of the Peruvian labor mar- ket from 2007 to 2011. We identify that women are the most likely to be wage discriminated with a probability of about 7%."

  bio: "This paper studies female labor supply in an urban search matching framework. In our model, unemployed women allocate their time between searching for jobs and managing the household affairs, such as raising children or doing household chores. Employed women allocate their time between working, commuting, and housework. We show that there is a unique equilibrium. To study the properties of the equilibrium, we perform a comparative statics analysis and discuss how family context, firms factors frictions in the labor market, and urban factors geographical location affect the equilibrium. After introducing commuting time into the search-matching model, the equilibrium becomes inefficient even under the Hosios condition. Finally, we calibrate our model to France and the United States and show the effects of different policies such as housework subsidies, commuting subsidies, and unemployment subsidies."

We estimate incumbents’ advantage for mayors in Chile and analyze how they are related to the vertical partisan affinity with the national government, shedding light on a financial advantage explanation to this phenomenon. We benefit from a rich dataset containing transfers from central government to municipalities related to two programs of high impact public works, which have a relevant degree of arbitrariness in the decision about the amounts transferred and about who receives them. This dataset let us get a deeper sense of electoral transfers by not relying on aggregate fiscal variables that much of the literature uses. Using the same RD approach, we estimate that the fact of being an incumbent of the same coalition of the national government explains a significant difference of around 29% in more municipal investment in public goods financed with fiscal funds. Moreover, for elections where there isn’t any partisan difference in the distribution of these funds, the electoral advantage disappears."

  bio: "We investigate how giant and supergiant oil and mineral discoveries shape the political fortunes of national leaders using a large dataset of 1255 leaders in 158 countries over the period 1950 to 2010. We depart from the existing literature by using both ‘single risk’ and ‘multiple risk’ discrete time proportional hazard models. We find that mineral discoveries reduce risk for the incumbent in a ‘single risk model’ especially in a non-election year. In contrast oil discoveries reduce risk disproportionately more for the incumbent in countries with weak political institutions. The effects appear to be induced by actual income or rent rather than income expectations. In a ‘multiple risk model’ oil discovery significantly reduces the risk of losing office via military coup while resource (oil and minerals) discovery in general reduces the risk of resignation. Resource discovery does not seem to have any impact on the risk of election loss."

  bio: "Even though political factors are cited in the theoretical literature as potential currency value determinants, few investigations have been conducted on the effect of these variables on the Real Exchange Rate (RER), notably in emerging and developing economies. With reference to the recently developed method of cross-section augmented ARDL approach (CS- ARDL), suggested by Chudik and Pesaran (2015) and the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) as annual data over the period 1984-2014, we investigate the long run response of RER to political risks by testing whether non-economic variables contribute to exchange rate determinants in 31 emergent and developing countries. Our main findings show that corruption and political instability can affect RER in the long-run and that more unstable political systems and more corrupt economies depreciate their real exchange rate. However, their statistical significance is weak. Furthermore, our investigation of the thresholds beyond which the effect of the instability and corruption variation indicates that a variation over 30% of political stability leads to a RER appreciation of approximately 10%, and a -10% variation to a RER depreciation of 9%. Besides, a variation beyond 70% of corruption control entails a RER appreciation of 5%, while a negative variation of -60% depreciates REER by 6%."

The model is structurally estimated using recent data for Chile, a country with a large fraction of employment in the public sector and a well known binding minimum wage. Results suggest a sizable productivity gap in favor of the private sector that, by a general equilibrum effect, is the main determinant of the bite of the minimum wage in both sectors observed in the data. Indeed, counterfactual experiments show that increasing productivity levels in the public sector to match those in the private sector has a large aggregate and distributive impact, reducing the fraction of minimum wage earners in the private sector almost by half. Our results highlight a previously unexplored margin of the effect of the minimum wage on the labor market."

  bio: "A number of policy discussions in macroeconomics have to do with the impact of commodity price fluctuations on fiscal revenue and expenditure in commodity exporting countries. Commodity price movements, however, have different sources depending on the nature of economic shocks. This paper proposes a panel SVAR approach that addresses this issue in three stages. First, we identify three structural shocks, two at the global level and one at the commodity market level, that affect commodity prices. Second, we study the effect of these shocks on three country-specific macroeconomic variables, real revenue, real expenditure, and the nominal exchange rate. Third, we exploit the cross-sectional dimension of our system at the country and commodity level to study the interactions of those three variables in terms of building fiscal space and absorbing the impact of commodity price fluctuations after the occurrence of structural shocks."

  bio: "In this paper I analyze the impact of micro level misallocation on aggregate growth in the economy. The inefficiency comes from imperfect information – intermediate goods producers make decisions based on noisy signals about the demand from the final good firm. I show that the rental rate of capital in such an economy is permanently lower, translating into slower (or even nil) long-run growth. For this purpose, I combine a Romer-style endogenous growth model with the model of misallocation of David, Hopenhayn, and Venkateswaran (2016). Such a formulation gives me the opportunity to consider also monetary policy, which is frequently seen as a remedy for information frictions in an economy. As an alternative to central bank’s actions I additionally introduce a sales tax, which, according to the preliminary results, seems to be the best solution to the misallocation problem."

  bio: "In this paper we develop a theoretical framework to study the role of expert services in a market for experience goods. We define these as goods whose quality becomes known to the consumers only after purchase. An expert offers to reveal information on the good’s quality to the consumers, in exchange for a fee. The market we examine is horizontally and vertically differentiated, with a good having a known feature (a type) and another that is unknown to the consumers (the quality). All consumers prefer a high quality good, with the utility derived from the type being match-dependent. We find expert services to increase consumers’ welfare, reducing their uncertainty and thus allowing for lower-type consumers to enter the market. The monopolist’s decisions remain impervious to the presence of the expert. Next we introduce user reviews in the form of a free-to-access rating of the good, written by consumers who had previously bought it and are currently out of the market. Due to technological and expertise limitations, the informational quality of user reviews is considered inferior to that of expert reviews. The presence of user reviews alters the composition of the market, allowing for high-type consumers to buy low-quality goods and viceversa."

  title: "Outliers in semi-parametric Estimation of Treatment Effects."
  bio: "Average treatment effects estimands can present significant bias under the presence of outliers. Moreover, outliers can be particularly hard to detect, creating bias and inconsistency in the semi-parametric ATE estimads. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that semi-parametric methods, such as matching, are biased in the presence of outliers. Bad and good leverage points outliers are considered. The bias arises because bad leverage points completely change the distribution of the metrics used to define counterfactuals. Whereas good leverage points increase the chance of breaking the common support condition and distort the balance of the covariates and which may push practitioners to misspecify the propensity score. We provide some clues to diagnose the presence of outliers and propose a reweighting estimator that is robust against outliers based on the Stahel-Donoho multivariate estimator of scale and location. An application of this estimator to LaLonde’s (1986) data allows us to explain the Dehejia and Wahba (2002) and Smith and Todd (2005) debate on the inability of matching estimators to deal with the evaluation problem."

  bio: "The economic impacts of resource-based development are distributed unevenly across national space, and not even mining regions experience economic development in the same way. We build on the methodology of Rehner et. al. (2014) to typify resource-based economic development in Peru in the period 2001- 2015 and compare it with the case of mineral-abundant Chile. What we find is a nuanced version of the same dependency-related resource curse phenomenon. With the commodity cycle: (i) export specialization is not the same in all places; (ii) regional growth volatility is much higher in Peru than in Chile; (iii) the Dutch disease does not clearly manifest itself; and therefore (iv) economic dependence within Peru is variegated. At the national level, gold-and-copper-dependent Peru is not as vulnerable as copper-dependent Chile to external shocks. At the subnational level, outside Lima in particular, dependence-related volatility can be very high for clusters of regions. The results of the quantitative analysis are attuned to a theoretical framework of variegated dependence, which, while acknowledging the centrality of the center-and-periphery supranational structure for economic development, attributes variation in resource curse phenomena to subnational differences across space and over time in economic-geography configurations and institutional regimes."

  title: "Dependent Local Development: The Restricted Linkage Effects of Mining on Agriculture in the Peruvian Andes, 1994-2012."
  bio: "We find that the benefits of the last mining boom in Peru on local agriculture were few, scattered, and non-substantial. Drawing on the last two Agrarian censuses (1994 and 2012), we run difference-in-differences estimations to explore the impacts of mining on local agriculture. We explore the effects resulting from two treatments: (i) being a mining district and (ii) being a district rich in mining-related fiscal transfers. These two associated but distinct treatments closely correspond with two different analytic concepts: (i) productive-linkage effects and (ii) fiscal-linkage effects. While we find almost no evidence of direct productive-linkage effects, we do identify some positive indirect fiscal- linkage effects in land use, education and construction income. However, becoming a fiscally rich mining district is also associated with a reduction in non-mining income other than construction, and a remarkable increase in the perception of water pollution. Our results are robust to changes in control variables and changes in the definition of “mining district”. Overall, the evidence backs a diagnosis of the enclave form of resource curse for local economies in the Peruvian Andes: mineral-based economic development takes an enclave form, in which linkages with the agriculture-based local economy are restricted to the fiscal channel. Coupled with the high perception of environmental leakages, this quantitative analysis aids in an understanding of the widespread discontent with mining in the Peruvian Andes."

  bio: "Studies that have looked at emigration rates and the development level of the area of origin have found a positive relation, at least for lower levels of development. Authors have argued that this pattern is explained by liquidity constraints. In this study we evaluate if geographic distance and agglomeration are factors that explain the positive relation that appears in the Peruvian data, for lower values of wealth. We use information of the National Census of 1993 and 2007 to estimate the effect of distance and agglomeration on migration and then estimate how these components change with wealth levels of the area of origin. Results show that agglomeration is an important factor behind the positive relation between wealth and emigration, for lower values of wealth. Thus, lower migration in poorer areas is partly explained by a lower profitability of migration, given that more promising areas are located at a greater distance."

  title: "Measuring Equality of Opportunity in Early Childhood:  A methodological proposal using Demographic and Health Surveys."
  bio: "There is conceptually a big difference between inequality of opportunity and inequality of outcomes, and the policies needed to address the two different kinds of inequality are also very different. However, it is difficult to measure inequality of opportunity. This paper proposes a new measure of equality of opportunity, based on the importance of family background variables for nutritional status in early childhood. We applied the proposed methodology to 166 Demographic and Health Surveys, from 60 different countries, carried out between 1991 and 2015. What stands out most strongly from these estimations is the low level of equality of opportunity in Latin America compared to the rest of the world. Family background is much more important for children’s nutritional status in this region than in the rest of the world. In contrast, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa were found to have surprisingly high equality of opportunity, suggesting that in this region other factors than family background determine nutritional outcomes."

The findings suggest that worsened parental mental health increases the probability of grade repetition and market work for children. The effects are not driven by those children whose parents had the worst mental health status at the onset of the survey, and are robust to alternative specifi- cations. Given the documented extensive underutilization of mental health services in Mexico, public interventions in this domain have the potential to come with pos- itive externalities and be cost-efficient."

We use data from Colombia to estimate the impact that protected areas had on violence perpetuated by guerrilla groups. We find protected areas that were established prior to 2002 significantly increased the number of guerrilla attacks in affected municipalities during the surge of violence in the mid-2000s. Our results are robust to the choice of estimator and numerous additional tests. We find evidence that our average impact estimates are largely driven by protection in the most rural areas, and that guerrillas were using protected areas as havens to conduct their operations."

Using the Ugandan annual panel household survey collected from 2009 to 2012 and monthly satellite rainfall data, this study reveals the causal impact of rainfall on domestic labor supply. The empirical results suggest that the decrease in within-spatial-area standard deviation of rainfall (precipitation z-score) by one increases the total number of hours that households spent on fetching water by 1.27 hours and decreases the time spent on agriculture by 3.84 hours. Heteroge- neous analysis revealed that the negative effect of rainfall on domestic labor is mostly incurred by children and women of all ages. In months where rainfall is lower than average, a decrease in rainfall is associated with increasing time for fetching water for women and children. Similarly, in months where rainfall is more than average, an increase in rainfall increases time for collecting firewood, especially for children age 5-9. The results highlight the negative impact of rainfall volatility and emphasize the importance of providing a stable water supply and assets such as modern cooking stove (LPG, Biomass)."

  title: "Water Common Pool Resource Management: Intergenarational Field Evidence in Bolivia."
  bio: "The Common Pool Resources (CPRs) are usually exploited one generation after another – meaning the prevalence of an intergetenarional link, this key dimension is often not take into account in field experiments. Given an intergenerational links for a CPRs, our first research question was: The subjects will increases their social preferences for the next generation? (intergenerational equity). The second one was: How the appropriators can contribute to the sustainability of the CPRs use?. The hypothesis is that ‘’intergenerational altruism” in a CPRs decreases exploitation as agents recognize that resource extraction not only creates negative externalities for the own generation, but also for all future generations. To probe this hypothesis we decide to conduct a field experiment in four communities located in the Bolivian department of Chuquisaca. The CPRs exploited in these communities is ‘’water’’ for farming activities. We want to study extraction behavior in farmer’s communities with installed dams in a context of multi-generational CPRs dynamic. Unfortunately our hypothesis was very optimistic, we verify that intergenerational link not mitigate the CPRs problem, but joint with ancestral arrangement of water managements, seems to be the best recipe."

  title: "Electricity Access Charges and Tariff Structure in Sub-Saharan Africa."
  bio: "Electrification rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are the lowest of any region in the world. In this paper we develop a model of household and electric utility behavior to describe how low access rates and high connection charges arise from regulated electricity tariffs being set too low. We use data from Uganda to estimate a household-level model of joint demand for energy consumption and energy source. Households choose between several fuel alternatives, including kerosene, grid electricity, and solar. We then use this demand model to analyze the incentives faced by the electric utility. When regulated tariffs are set too low, the utility loses money on each connected customer. Low electricity consumption by households also makes it difficult to recover the cost of providing a connection. For each possible choice of regulated tariff, we compute the optimal upfront connection charge that will maximize profits for the utility in its service territory. Higher tariffs are associated with lower optimal connection charges and higher electrification rates, though equilibrium electrification rates in our model are still much lower than 100 percent."

Using the random nature of the gender of newborn children, this study quantifies the causal impact of having a third same sex child on the probability that the mother will experience domestic violence. The empirical results from 2005-2006 India’s National Family Survey (NFHS) suggest that, among women who already have given birth to two girls, giving birth to a third girl increases the probability of domestic violence compared to giving birth to the son. After taking the possibility of sex-selective abortion into account, domestic violence indicators for households with three consecutive female births increase by 0.147, which is a 13.4% increase from the average score. For households with two boys, having a third boy, compared to a third girl, increases the domestic violence indicator by 0.135 (11.6% increase). The comparatively higher increase in domestic violence related to girls births for households with two previous girls reflects the son preference in India."

Critically, however, we find that these effects are short-lived and dissipate approximately 2 years after the antidumping decision. Furthermore, antidumping actions against China prompt a substitution effect as they increase US imports from other countries. In general, our results cast doubt on the effectiveness of antidumping actions against China as mechanisms for protecting US producers."

In the context of the slow recovery of world economy, China’s outward economic activities have found themselves in many parts of the globe, even in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, some of the farthest places away from China. While many scholars have conducted extensive studies on China’s trade and FDI in Latin America the Caribbean, this paper focuses on Chinese contracts in LAC, a topic that has been rarely studied. Using both random-effects model and fixed-effects model and covering thirty LAC countries during 1998-2015, the multivariate panel regressions show that among numerous determinants, Chinese companies prefer to undertake projects in the countries that are economically more advanced, more populous, with a higher political rights score, with an expansionary economy, and last but not the least, with higher rent of natural resources (for the fulfilled amount of contracts)."

Methodology wise this study however improves on previous ones, by expanding the geographic focus worldwide, shifting patterns, incentivizing factors and using more realistic effective rather than statutory tax rates. Moreover, it identifies profit-shifting through earnings shocks relative to comparable firms that are only passed on to those other MNC affiliates located in lower taxed countries. The study can thereby control for country-pair-year fixed effects instead of relying on infrequent potentially endogenous changes in tax rates and differences. Rather than rejecting the existence of profit- shifting, these results raise concern about time and sample robustness of studies using the Orbis database and urge for better data. Besides, the findings suggest that profit-shifting strategies have become more complex and likely not incorporating shifting opportunities arising from windfall profits."

  title: "Dependent Local Development: The Restricted Linkage Effects of Mining on Agriculture in the Peruvian Andes, 1994-2012."
  bio: "We find that the benefits of the last mining boom in Peru on local agriculture were few, scattered, and non-substantial. Drawing on the last two Agrarian censuses (1994 and 2012), we run difference-in-differences estimations to explore the impacts of mining on local agriculture. We explore the effects resulting from two treatments: (i) being a mining district and (ii) being a district rich in mining-related fiscal transfers. These two associated but distinct treatments closely correspond with two different analytic concepts: (i) productive-linkage effects and (ii) fiscal-linkage effects. While we find almost no evidence of direct productive-linkage effects, we do identify some positive indirect fiscal- linkage effects in land use, education and construction income. However, becoming a fiscally rich mining district is also associated with a reduction in non-mining income other than construction, and a remarkable increase in the perception of water pollution. Our results are robust to changes in control variables and changes in the definition of “mining district”. Overall, the evidence backs a diagnosis of the enclave form of resource curse for local economies in the Peruvian Andes: mineral-based economic development takes an enclave form, in which linkages with the agriculture-based local economy are restricted to the fiscal channel. Coupled with the high perception of environmental leakages, this quantitative analysis aids in an understanding of the widespread discontent with mining in the Peruvian Andes."

We find robust evidence that teacher strikes worsens future labor market outcomes: being exposed to the average incidence of teacher strikes during primary school (88 days) reduces labor earnings and wages for 30-40 year olds by 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that this amounts to an aggregate earnings loss of $712 million in Argentina annually. We also find evidence of an increase in unemployment, lower labor force participation and a reduction in the skill levels of the occupations to which students sort. Examining short- and long-run educational outcomes demonstrate that these adverse labor market effects are driven, at least in part, by a reduction in educational attainment. We also document statistically significant intergenerational treatment effects; children of individuals exposed to teacher strikes during primary school also experience adverse educational attainment effects."

Because we kept group assignment secret we can estimate the pure effect of group composition, with less of a potentially planned response by the instructors. Our evi- dence suggests, then, that tracking per-se does not pay off for everyone, but there are benefits from having more diverse peers. In particular we find that non-household heads (relatively less experienced) placed in high-labor attachment groups benefits the most. We argue that these results may come from learning from peers, as network formation is unaffected."

Aplicando el filtro estadístico propuesto por Christiano y Fitzgerald, identificamos las tendencias de estas variables para estudiar las relaciones de largo plazo exentas de fluctuaciones inducidas por factores coyunturales internos o externos a la economía boliviana. Esta investigación muestra inicialmente una revisión histórica de estas relaciones, de igual manera, identifica los períodos en los que cada recurso natural fue predominante en la estructura de las exportaciones bolivianas. En este contexto, demostramos que el 83% y el 79% de la tendencia del crecimiento económico puede ser explicada, respectivamente, por la tendencia del precio del estaño en el período de 1970 a 1986 y por la tendencia del precio del gas natural en el período del 2000 al 2013. Encontramos, además, que en el período de 1987 a 1999, ninguno de los recursos naturales predominantes en las exportaciones del zinc, la plata y el oro, pueden explicar el 10% de la tendencia de crecimiento económico en el país."

  title: "Relationship between income inequality, economic growth, education and poverty: an explanation through Kuznets for Chile."
  rockstar: false
  bio: "This paper analyzes the development of the Chilean economy and its relation to income
  inequality, per capita income, poverty and education, using time series data for the period between 1984 and 2013. It also shows the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between the analyzed variables, and then it consistently (i) tests the Kuznets hypothesis that postulates an inverted U relationship between inequality and income level, (ii) identifies the role of poverty throughout the entire development process; and (iii) determines whether education served as an equalizing mechanism of income. We show that Chile has been having a developing process similar to the Kuznets type, and we provide evidence suggesting that this process does not seem to have been driven by improvements in the level of education, begin of a certain irrelevance as an income-equalizing mechanism. Finally, we show that there is a persistent trade-off between inequality and poverty."

  rockstar: false
  bio: "Research in psychology has suggested that parental depression translates into bad parenting and worsened behavioral outcomes for children. In this article, I look at the effect of depression on child education and labor outcomes in Mexico. Using a rich panel data set and making use of violent assault as a source of exogenous vari- ation in depressive symptoms, I estimate the impact of a shock to parents’ mental health on a series of child outcomes. The findings suggest that worsened parental mental health increases the probability of grade repetition and market work for children. The effects are not driven by those children whose parents had the worst mental health status at the onset of the survey, and are robust to alternative specifi- cations. Given the documented extensive underutilization of mental health services in Mexico, public interventions in this domain have the potential to come with pos- itive externalities and be cost-efficient."

  title: "Revisiting the Exchange Rate Pass Through: A General Equilibrium Perspective"
  coauthors: "Javier García-Cicco (Banco Central de Chile)"
  rockstar: false
  bio: "A large literature estimates the exchange rate pass-through to prices (ERPT) using reduced- form approaches, whose results are an important input at Central Banks. We study the usefulness of these empirical measures for actual monetary policy analysis and decision making, emphasizing two main problems that arise naturally from a general equilibrium perspective. First, while the literature describes a single ERPT measure, in a general equilibrium model the evolution of the exchange rate and prices will differ depending on the shock hitting the economy. Accordingly, we distinguish between conditional and unconditional ERPT measures, showing that they can lead to very different interpretations of the likely dynamic of prices after a given change in the exchange rate. Second, in a general equilibrium model the ERPT crucially depends on the expected behavior of monetary policy, but the empirical approaches in the literature cannot account for this. Thus, relying on these measures as a guide for monetary policy analysis is equivalent to believe that the actual behaviour of the exchange rate (and prices) will be independent from policy. We highlight the quantitative relevance of these distinctions by means of a DSGE model of a small and open economy with sectoral distinctions, real and nominal rigidities, and a variety of driving forces; es- timated using Chilean data."

  bio: "Este trabajo estima el riesgo sistémico de liquidez en el mercado interbancario a partir del comportamiento de variables bancarias agregadas, macroeconómicas y de política que se relacionan con el proceso de creación primaria de dinero en la economía. Para ello, se utiliza la metodología de pasivos contingentes de Merton (1974) y Grey y Malone (2008). La información producida por el modelo (probabilidad y distancia al default) explican y mejoran la predicción tanto de los montos transados como de las tasas de interés pactadas en el mercado overnight. Para el caso venezolano, dada la importancia de la gestión fiscal en la creación primaria de dinero, se muestra que una mayor incidencia fiscal tiende a reducir la posibilidad de eventos de iliquidez. Un aumento del encaje legal aumenta la probabilidad de default al incrementar las obligaciones de los bancos en el corto plazo. "

  rockstar: false
  bio: "We develop a DSGE model for a small, open economy with a bank- ing sector and endogenous default. The model is used to perform a re- alistic assessment of two macroprudential tools: countercyclical capital buffers (CCB) and dynamic provisions (DP). The model is estimated with data for Uruguay, where dynamic provisioning is in place since early 2000s. In general, while both tools force banks to build buffers, we find that DP seems to outperform the CCB in terms of smooth- ing the cycle. We also find that the source of the shock affecting the financial system matters to discuss the relative performance of both tools. In particular, given a positive external shock the ratio of credit to GDP decreases, which discourages its use as an indicator variable to activate countercyclical regulation."

  title: "Mortgage Credit: Lending and Borrowing Constraints in a DSGE Framework"
  rockstar: false
  bio: "This paper develops a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework to evaluate the relative importance of the easing of lending and borrowing constraints in mortgage credit markets for business cycle fluctuations in small open emerging economies. Credit markets are characterized by partial dollarization and are subject to demand shocks, positive innovations to stochastic loan-to-value ratios imposed on borrowers, and supply shocks, negative innovations to stochastic bank capital-to-asset ratios imposed on financial intermediaries. In addition, the model features a set of real and nominal domestic shocks to demand, productivity, and fiscal and monetary policy, as well as foreign shocks. The model is calibrated and estimated using data on the Peruvian economy. A historical decomposition conducted on household leverage ratios reveals that these variables’ cyclical dynamics were mainly driven by borrowing constraint shocks or credit demand shifts, while lending constraint shocks played a residual role. Counterfactual simulations also provide evidence in favor of this channel: turning off the borrowing constraint shocks significantly attenuates the fluctuations of leverage ratios from their steady-state levels. The importance of the demand channel in Peru is consistent with mortgage demand-boosting public programs enacted in the 2000s. While applied in the Peruvian context here, the framework is easily adaptable to the historical evolution of credit markets in a large variety of emerging market economies."

A finales de 2014, la economía boliviana a pesar de enfrentar shocks externos negativos (caída del precio del petróleo), registra un crecimiento económico elevado en la región de Latinoamérica, la política monetaria fue dirigida a mantener la tasa de títulos públicos cercanas a cero y elevar los niveles de liquidez en la economía (política monetaria expansiva).

En resumen, las características de la economía boliviana en los últimos años generan la necesidad de evaluar la coordinación de política monetaria y fiscal. La estructura de un Modelo de Equilibrio General Dinámico Estocástico (DSGE) ayudo a develar la coordinación entre dos tipos de reglas monetarias (regla de Taylor y regla de McCallum) y una regla fiscal adicional, dado que a brotes inflacionarios la política monetaria y fiscal actúan de manera contracíclica a la elevación del nivel de precios, se evidencia que ambas políticas están sujetas en función al comportamiento de la otra (à la Leeper)."
