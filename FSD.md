The 8th Bolivian Conference on Development Economics (BCDE8) and the IDB’s Financial Stability and Development (FSD) network of South American Central Banks are pleased to organize a workshop on **New Modeling Challenges for Central Banks in Latin America**. The workshop will run parallel to contributed sessions of BCDE8.

#### Motivation

As developed economies recover slowly from a long period of depressed aggregate demand and China’s growth continues to slow down, emerging economies in Latin America are preparing their policy toolbox to address vulnerabilities from this changing environment. The rebalancing of economic growth across emerging and developed economies might trigger a new wave of capital flows reversals, exchange rate devaluations, tighter financial conditions, and persistently low levels of commodity prices, posing new challenges for monetary policy authorities across emerging economies. Furthermore, domestic vulnerabilities might also put pressure on monetary policy as persistent fiscal imbalances have eroded domestic public buffers.
In this context, new tools and methods to study capital flow management, macro-prudential policies, financial stability, policy spillovers and fiscal and monetary policy coordination are high on the research agenda of many central banks in the region. The goal of this workshop is to gather ongoing research papers from central banks in the region that are incorporating these challenges into the otherwise standard modeling framework that have guided monetary policy making in the region.

#### Venue and Agenda

The workshop will be hosted by the 8th Bolivian Conference on Development Economics at Universidad Privada Boliviana in Cochabamba, Bolivia on Friday, October 27th. The workshop agenda is:
