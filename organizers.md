#### Society of Bolivian Economists [(SEBOL)](www.sebol.org.bo)
SEBOL is a network of economics professionals formed in 2008 by a group of Bolivian economists graduated from masters and doctoral programs all over the world, and working in academia in various countries. The main objective of this network is to promote research for development, particularly focused on creating knowledge and lessons applicable to the Bolivian economy and society.

SEBOL currently has more than 80 members, including two honorary members, all of whom are Bolivian academics such as researchers, consultants, and PhD students. The honorary members are Juan Antonio Morales (former President of the Central Bank of Bolivia) and Enrique García (Executive President of CAF – Development Bank of Latin America).

#### Universidad Privada Boliviana [(UPB)](www.upb.edu.bo)
The UPB is a leading private University in Bolivia, grew from a simple idea: a commitment to excellence. Our success is the fruit of many years of careful planning and market research to become the most important university business world, as well as the leader in private universities of the country.

UPB was created by the Bolivian business community to generate entrepreneurs and fulfill the need of private firms for skilled management and technical professionals with the following Vision: To be the best university in Bolivia and a reference for quality education in Latin America. On the other hand, our Mission is: To generate, adapt and apply knowledge through research, transmit it in the classroom and share its application to the community. Our core values are committed to academic excellence, quality administration, ethical behavior at all levels, foster competitiveness, promotes free enterprise values and sustainable development.

#### Institute for Advanced Development Studies [(INESAD)](www.inesad.edu.bo)
At the Institute for Advanced Development Studies (INESAD) we are convinced that social and economic transformation must come from within. Furthermore, we believe that development research is a field that must be led by researchers who live with the problems of under-development on a daily basis, as these researchers are better positioned to prioritize and propose viable solutions for overcoming the most critical obstacles for socioeconomic sustainable development.

Thus, INESAD’s dream is to construct a space in Bolivia, where top researchers in matters of development have access to the resources, tools and inspiration necessary to conduct scientific research of a high standard and relevance, and in this way help improve public policy at all levels. In this space we particularly wish to support the formation of future generations of researchers and impart to them a passion for the scientific research of development. To this end we launched the Ambassador Internship Program, among other initiatives.

At INESAD we consider that socioeconomic sustainable development must involve three spheres: Economic, Social and Environmental. Although the economic method leads most of the research projects developed by, INESAD, we believe that the most novel and fruitful research is produced as a result of the intersection of the three fields. In this way, we find ourselves building a multi-disciplinary team with an enthusiasm for exploring new horizons, working within an environment of openness and collaborating with institutions with different focuses, perspectives and viewpoints, in order to work together find practical ways to overcome the existing obstacles to development.

#### The Bolivian Academy of Economic Sciences (ABCE)
The Bolivian Academy of Economic Sciences (ABCE) is a private, non-profit society of distinguished scholars. Founded in 1969, the ABCE is Bolivia’s top learned society and independent reference institution in the field of economic development. The ABCE is charged with providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to economic science. Members are elected by their peers to membership in the ABCE for outstanding contributions to economic science research, entrepreneurship and statesmanship in the field of economic policy.  The ABCE is committed to furthering science in Bolivia and its members are active contributors to the international scientific community. Many of its members lead the most representative economic and social research institutions of Bolivia.

A number of colleges, universities, and cultural and scientific institutions collaborate with the ABCE by participating in its studies and helping to support its efforts to advance the common good.  The ABCE and its affiliates share a commitment to the vitality of higher education and the value of research. By partnering with the ABCE in its endeavors, its affiliates provide a critical public service to Bolivia and South America.
