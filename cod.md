BCDE8 prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means disrespectful behavior isn’t allowed at BCDE8 meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Engaging in any of these behaviors may result in getting expelled from the conference.

Please report any disrespectful behavior to BCDE8 organizers and they will take care of it.
