We're very excited about BCDE8, not only because it will take place in a great city,
but also because our team are putting together a great program and contacting outstanding
speakers to join us in Cochabamba.

#### About Cochabamba

Cochabamba’s metropolitan area is the third largest region in Bolivia in terms of population (1.14 million). Located at the heart of Bolivian valleys, it enjoys a privileged weather all year with average temperatures between 13 °C - 19 °C. In October, you should expect warm spring weather.

Cochabamba is well known for having an exquisite traditional gastronomy, as well as excellent health and education services. Its vibrant and fast-growing economic activity has made the capital municipality of Cochabamba the highest-ranked region in Bolivia in terms of UNDP’s HDI, according to their last report at the municipal level.
